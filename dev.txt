Write the README.md in markdown for my project 
USPs:
- no label dependency between compilation units
- each unit can ignore, inherit, overwrite or rename sub unit labels
- can specify a custom logging handler
- no performance hit because thunk is used,

explain that it is a singleton class. explain how to init the LOGR with labels and toggle. what is the different formats of labels and toggles; how they conside with the bits. explain that the format of a log statement should look like. when the log function returns true, false or undefined.
explain how a static function can be used to increase performance instead of LOGR.log.
should explain with examples how to use the l_xxxx utility/helper functions.
examples for how to set the labels. how to set the labels when importing labels from submodules. how to use the OR for labels in logs statements. 
explain how to use it in dev and in production. 


v0 to v1
- LOGR is exported, so direct access to LOGR.labels instead of export of l.
- rename class
- LOGR is a singleton
